# EnocaChallenge
 Challenge Project I've developed for ENOCA internship application.
 <br>
 This is a basic order management system for companies.
 <br><br>
 I've developed this project using .NET Core 6 API, MSSQL, Swagger UI, EF Core Code First,
 <br>
 Repository Design Pattern (Read/Write separated for SOLID) and Onion Architecture.
 <br><br>
 User can use these operations via following SwaggerUI:
 <br>
 Can see a specific Company or all Companies. (GET)
 <br>
 Can add Companies, Products and Orders. (POST)
 <br>
 Can modify a companies business hours and Approval status (PUT)
 <br><br>
Please use "00:00" format without double quotes for any time input.
<br>
Because of time constraints and for keeping the project simple I didn't implement broad controls for that.
<br><br>
You can find SQL script in SQLScript file.
<br>
You can reach me with my mail address burakyavuzcengel@gmail.com for any questions/problems you encounter.
<br>
Thank you for your time and good day!
